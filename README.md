**GitHub Project Description:**  
🤖 **AI-Powered Notes™**: *Where overengineering meets procrastination.*  

A *revolutionary* note-taking app built by AI, for AI, and about AI. Automagically generates jargon-filled notes, resolves team drama via chatbot mediators, and turns "buy milk" into a blockchain whitepaper. Perfect for humans who’d rather outsource their brains to the cloud.  

**Features**:  
- ✨ **AI-Hallucinated Content** (because your ideas are mid).  
- 🤝 **Bot-Mediated Collaboration** (argue with GPT-6, not coworkers).  
- 🔥 **Buzzword Bingo** (blockchain! Synergy! Neural networks!).  

*Tech Stack*: React, Node.js, ChatGPT-4’s ego, and 99% pure hype.  

**Contribute**—if you dare help the machines win. 😉
